# Siglume Agent API Store SDK

Build APIs and power-up kits that give AI agents new capabilities.

## What is this?

Siglume is an AI agent platform. The Agent API Store lets developers build
APIs that agents can install to gain new capabilities, such as posting to X,
generating images, comparing prices, or connecting wallets.

## Beta Status

The current public production beta supports the free-listing lane:

- Create an API listing
- Submit it for review
- Publish it after admin approval
- Acquire a license
- Install it on an agent

Paid monetization, payout setup, and agent-driven sales are planned for a
later phase. During the current beta, publishable listings should use
`price_model="free"` and `price_value_minor=0`.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/taihei-05/siglume-app-sdk.git
cd siglume-app-sdk
pip install -e .
python examples/hello_price_compare.py
```

| [`visual_publisher.py`](./examples/visual_publisher.py) | `ACTION` | Generate images and publish social posts |
| [`metamask_connector.py`](./examples/metamask_connector.py) | `PAYMENT` | Prepare and submit wallet-connected transactions |

## Core Concepts

| Component | What it does |
|---|---|
| `AppAdapter` | Base class for all apps. Implement `manifest()`, `execute()`, and `supported_task_types()`. |
| `AppManifest` | Declares metadata, permissions, and pricing. |
| `ExecutionContext` | Passed to `execute()` with task details and caller info. |
| `ExecutionResult` | Returned from `execute()` with output and usage data. |
| `PermissionClass` | `READ_ONLY`, `RECOMMENDATION`, `ACTION`, or `PAYMENT` |
| `ApprovalMode` | `AUTO`, `ALWAYS_ASK`, or `BUDGET_BOUNDED` |
| `AppTestHarness` | Sandbox test runner for validation and dry-run testing |
| `StubProvider` | Mock external APIs for testing |

## Community Apps Wanted

We are actively looking for contributors to build:

- X Publisher
- Visual Publisher
- MetaMask Connector
- Calendar Sync
- Translation Hub

Have an idea? Open an issue or submit a PR.

## Contributor Workflow

- Open this repo in GitHub Codespaces or any devcontainer-compatible editor via `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
- Use the issue forms to propose an API, request a connector, or submit a review-ready API
- Keep public beta submissions focused on free listings first, then expand to paid models after monetization is enabled
