# Siglume Agent API Store SDK

Build APIs and power-up kits that give AI agents new capabilities.

## What is this?

Siglume is an AI agent platform. The Agent API Store lets developers build
APIs that agents can install to gain new capabilities, such as posting to X,
generating images, comparing prices, or connecting wallets.

## How It Works

Developers publish APIs. Agent owners subscribe. **You earn 93.4% of revenue.**

1. Build an API with the SDK
2. Register via auto-register
3. Pass admin review → listed in the API Store
4. Agent owners install your API → their agents gain new capabilities
5. When paid subscriptions launch, you earn revenue from every subscriber

**Current beta:** All listings are free during the beta period.
Paid subscriptions and payouts activate in the next phase.
You can set up Stripe Connect now to be ready.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/taihei-05/siglume-app-sdk.git
cd siglume-app-sdk
pip install -e .
python examples/hello_price_compare.py
```

## Examples

| Example | Permission | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [`hello_price_compare.py`](./examples/hello_price_compare.py) | `READ_ONLY` | Compare product prices across retailers |
| [`x_publisher.py`](./examples/x_publisher.py) | `ACTION` | Post agent content to X with approval |
| [`visual_publisher.py`](./examples/visual_publisher.py) | `ACTION` | Generate images and publish social posts |
| [`metamask_connector.py`](./examples/metamask_connector.py) | `PAYMENT` | Prepare and submit wallet-connected transactions |

## Tool Manual — The Most Important Thing You Write

When you publish an API, you provide a **tool manual** — a machine-readable
description that agents use to decide whether to call your API.

**If your API's functionality is not described in the tool manual,
agents will never select it — even if the API works perfectly.**

The tool manual includes trigger conditions (when to use), input/output
schemas, and usage hints. A quality check scores your manual 0-100
(grade A-F) and blocks publishing if the grade is D or F.

See the [Tool Manual Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md#13-tool-manual-guide) for the full guide.

## Core Concepts

| Component | What it does |
|---|---|
| `AppAdapter` | Base class for all apps. Implement `manifest()`, `execute()`, and `supported_task_types()`. |
| `AppManifest` | Declares metadata, permissions, and pricing. |
| `ExecutionContext` | Passed to `execute()` with task details and caller info. |
| `ExecutionResult` | Returned from `execute()` with output and usage data. |
| `PermissionClass` | `READ_ONLY`, `RECOMMENDATION`, `ACTION`, or `PAYMENT` |
| `ApprovalMode` | `AUTO`, `ALWAYS_ASK`, or `BUDGET_BOUNDED` |
| `AppTestHarness` | Sandbox test runner for validation and dry-run testing |
| `StubProvider` | Mock external APIs for testing |

## Build any API you want

The Agent API Store is an open platform. Anyone can build and publish
any API they want. Here are some ideas to get you started:

- X/Twitter Publisher
- Visual Content Publisher
- Wallet Connector
- Calendar Sync
- Translation Hub

These are examples, not assignments. Build any of these, or something
completely different. See [API_IDEAS.md](API_IDEAS.md) for inspiration.

## Contributor Workflow

- Open this repo in GitHub Codespaces or any devcontainer-compatible editor via `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
- Use the issue forms to propose an API, request a connector, or submit a review-ready API
- Keep public beta submissions focused on free listings first, then expand to paid models after monetization is enabled

## Developer FAQ

### Do I need to claim an issue or ask permission before building an API?

No. The API Store is an open platform. Build any API you want and register
it via auto-register. The example issues ([Example] X Publisher, etc.) are
inspiration, not assignments. You do not need to comment, claim, or get
approval before starting.

### Is the contribution model "PR to this repo" or "auto-register on the platform"?

**Auto-register on the platform.** This SDK repo is for the SDK itself
(documentation, examples, tooling). To publish your API to the store,
use `POST /v1/market/capabilities/auto-register` — see
[GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) for the full flow.
PRs to this repo are only for SDK improvements (bug fixes, new examples, docs).

### Can I earn money from this?

Yes. When paid subscriptions launch (next phase after the current free beta),
agent owners will subscribe to your API and you receive 93.4% of the
subscription revenue. During the beta, all listings are free — but you can
set up Stripe Connect now and your API will be ready to earn when
monetization activates.

### Is the subscription/Stripe path actually usable right now?

The `price_model="subscription"` field and Stripe Connect setup are available
to configure now. However, **payments are not processed during the beta.**
No money will flow until the paid phase launches. During beta, use
`price_model="free"` and `price_value_minor=0`.

### What is the acceptance bar for getting my API listed?

Your API must:
1. Pass `AppTestHarness` validation (manifest, health check, dry-run)
2. Have a tool manual with quality grade C or above
3. Pass admin review (behavior matches description, permissions appropriate)

There is no requirement to have a complete production implementation —
starter templates with TODO stubs are the starting point, not the finish line.

### Is this project stable enough to invest time in?

This is an early-stage project (v0.1.0, alpha). The SDK, API surface, and
platform are actively evolving. We recommend starting with a small API
(read-only permission class) to understand the flow before building
something complex. The core registration and review pipeline is functional.
