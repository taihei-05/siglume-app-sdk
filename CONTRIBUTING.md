# Contributing to Siglume Agent API Store SDK

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide covers the practical steps.

## Dev Environment Setup

```bash

cd siglume-app-sdk
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

```

## Creating a New App

1. Fork this repository.
2. Copy `examples/hello_price_compare.py` or one of the community templates in `examples/` as a starting point.
3. Implement the `AppAdapter` interface from `siglume_app_sdk.py`.
4. Test your app locally using `AppTestHarness`, or run your example script directly:
   ```bash
   python examples/hello_price_compare.py
   ```
5. If you add a new sample app, place it under `examples/` and document what it does in the PR description.

## Submitting Changes

1. Create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes with clear, focused commits.
3. Ensure all tests pass before opening a PR.
4. Open a pull request against `main` with a description of what changed and why.
