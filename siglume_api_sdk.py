"""Siglume Agent App SDK — interface definitions for external developers.

This module defines the contracts that app developers implement to create

An "agent app" is a power-up kit that gives a Siglume AI agent new capabilities.
For example: Amazon price comparison, travel booking, CRM sync, etc.

Developers implement the AppAdapter protocol and register it with Siglume.
