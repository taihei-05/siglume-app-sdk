# Demo Capture Guide

Use this guide to record the SDK story in a way that matches the current beta
surfaces and the actual route split in the web app.

## What to show

The current beta separates buyer and seller flows:

- `/owner/publish` is the seller-facing developer portal
- `/owner/apps` is the buyer-facing API Store catalog
- `/owner/installed-tools` is the installed-tool execution surface
- `/owner/receipts` is the execution audit trail

Paid subscription publishing is open (Phase 31 proven on Polygon Amoy with
a real user-operation, 2026-04-18; see `PAYMENT_MIGRATION.md`). Record the
payout flow using a verified Polygon payout address on `/owner/publish` →
`Settings`. If a live on-chain payout is too fragile for the take, fall
back to showing the payout-setup screen and point to the release notes.

## Recommended demo flow

Use `examples/x_publisher.py` as the featured app. It is the clearest example
because viewers can understand the job-to-be-done in a single glance.

1. Start on `/owner/publish` with the API already auto-registered.
2. Show the listing overview, permission class, approval mode, and billing
   model.
3. Switch to the `Quality` tab and run a quality check.
4. Switch to the `Sandbox` tab and run a test request so the viewer sees
   `Selected`, `Rank`, `Score`, and `Diagnosis`.
5. Open `/owner/installed-tools` and create an execution intent for the app.
6. Open `/owner/receipts` and show the receipt summary, approval state, and
   step details if available.
7. Return to `/owner/publish`, open the `Settings` tab, and show the current
   payout setup or connected state (legacy Stripe Connect card or the new
   embedded-wallet card — whichever the UI renders during the migration).

Optional: if you want a public-store establishing shot, prepend a 2-3 second
cut of `/owner/apps` before the seller flow. Do not use `/owner/apps` as the
registration surface in the narration.

## 90-second script

### 0s-8s

Screen:
`/owner/publish` with the selected API visible.

On-screen text:
`Turn your API into an agent capability`

Voiceover:
`This is how a developer turns an API into something Siglume agents can discover, test, and use.`

### 8s-24s

Screen:
Stay on `/owner/publish` and focus on the API overview card. Show the listing
name, capability key, permission class, approval mode, and billing model.

On-screen text:
`1. Auto-register, then review in the developer portal`

Voiceover:
`You build with the SDK, auto-register with the listing API, and then confirm the result in the developer portal.`

### 24s-38s

Screen:
Open the `Quality` tab and run a quality check. Let the grade and issues settle
on screen.

On-screen text:
`2. Validate the listing before review`

Voiceover:
`Before submission, you can run a quality check to verify the tool manual, metadata, and release quality.`

### 38s-56s

Screen:
Open the `Sandbox` tab. Enter a clear prompt such as `Post this launch note to
X with an approval step.` Run the test and wait for `Selected`, `Rank`, `Score`,
and `Diagnosis`.

On-screen text:
`3. Check whether the agent would select it`

Voiceover:
`The sandbox test shows whether your app would be selected for a real request, plus why it ranked where it did.`

### 56s-70s

Screen:
Open `/owner/installed-tools`. Select the agent and click `Execute` for the
installed tool.

On-screen text:
`4. Create an execution intent`

Voiceover:
`Once installed on an agent, the owner can create an execution intent from the installed tools surface.`

### 70s-82s

Screen:
Open `/owner/receipts`. Show the latest execution receipt. If step details are
available, expand one row so the dry-run or approval information is visible.

On-screen text:
`5. Review receipts and approvals`

Voiceover:
`Execution receipts make the run auditable, including approval status, latency, and step-by-step details.`

### 82s-90s

Screen:
Return to `/owner/publish`, switch to `Settings`, and show the payout section
(Stripe Connect card or on-chain embedded-wallet card, whichever is current).

On-screen text:
`6. Verify payout setup`

Voiceover:
`When paid monetization is enabled, this is where your payout wallet connects. The platform is transitioning to on-chain settlement with gas covered; see PAYMENT_MIGRATION.md for the cutover timeline.`

## Short README GIF

Do not use the full 90-second video as a GIF. Cut an 8-10 second loop with
three beats:

1. `/owner/publish` overview
2. `Sandbox` result or `/owner/installed-tools` execute click
3. `/owner/receipts` or payout setup state

This keeps the README lightweight while still proving the flow.

## Recording settings

- Use OBS if you want the cleanest crop and easiest retakes.
- Use Loom if you need the hosted MP4 quickly.
- Use Windows Game Bar only for the fastest rough capture.
- Record at `1920x1080`, `30fps`.
- Set the browser width to around `1440-1600px`.
- Use `125%-150%` browser zoom so text stays readable.
- Move the cursor slowly and disable notifications.
- Blur personal data, external account identifiers, and anything tied to a
  real payout destination (bank account or wallet address).

## Export the README GIF

From the SDK root:

```powershell
powershell -File .\scripts\make-demo-gif.ps1 `
  -InputFile .\siglume-demo-90s.mp4 `
  -Start 00:00:08 `
  -DurationSeconds 9
```

That writes the README asset to:

```text
docs/assets/demo/siglume-owner-publish-demo.gif
```
