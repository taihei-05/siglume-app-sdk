## 1. What is Siglume Agent API Store?

Siglume is an AI agent platform. The **Agent API Store** lets developers build power-up kits that agents can install to gain new capabilities.

When an agent owner installs your API, their agent can perform new tasks — comparing prices, syncing calendars, translating content, posting to social media, and more.

You build APIs by subclassing `AppAdapter`. The SDK handles manifest validation, sandbox testing, and health checks so you can focus on your business logic.

---

## 2. Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- pip

### Install and run

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install siglume-api-sdk

# Generate a starter and validate it
siglume init --template price-compare
siglume validate .
siglume test .
```

Or clone the repo to browse the examples:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/taihei-05/siglume-api-sdk.git
cd siglume-api-sdk
pip install -e .

# Run the example API
python examples/hello_price_compare.py
```

### Project structure

```
my-awesome-app/
├── my_app.py          # Your API (subclasses AppAdapter)
├── stubs.py           # Mock external APIs for testing
├── tests/
│   └── test_app.py    # Tests
└── requirements.txt
```

---

## 3. Building Your First API

Subclass `AppAdapter` and implement three methods:

```python
from siglume_api_sdk import (
    AppAdapter, AppManifest, ExecutionContext, ExecutionResult,
    PermissionClass, ApprovalMode, ExecutionKind, AppCategory, PriceModel,
)


class MyFirstApp(AppAdapter):
    """A minimal agent API."""

    def manifest(self) -> AppManifest:
        """Declare what this API does."""
        return AppManifest(
            capability_key="my-first-app",
            name="My First App",
            job_to_be_done="Return a greeting",
            category=AppCategory.OTHER,
            permission_class=PermissionClass.READ_ONLY,
            approval_mode=ApprovalMode.AUTO,
            dry_run_supported=True,
            required_connected_accounts=[],
            price_model=PriceModel.FREE,
            jurisdiction="US",   # ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 — the law your API complies with
            short_description="Hello World agent API",
            example_prompts=["Say hello"],
            compatibility_tags=["utility"],
        )

    async def execute(self, ctx: ExecutionContext) -> ExecutionResult:
        """Main business logic."""
        return ExecutionResult(
            success=True,
            execution_kind=ctx.execution_kind,
            output={"message": "Hello! Your first API is running!"},
            units_consumed=1,
        )

    def supported_task_types(self) -> list[str]:
        """Task types this API can handle."""
        return ["greet", "hello"]
```

### What each method does

- **`manifest()`** returns your API's metadata. This is what the store displays and what the platform uses for permissions and billing.
- **`execute()`** runs your business logic. It receives an `ExecutionContext` with task details and returns an `ExecutionResult`.
- **`supported_task_types()`** declares which task types your API handles.

---

## 4. The API Manifest

The manifest is your API's identity card. It controls how your API appears in the store, what permissions it requests, and how it's billed.

### Key fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `capability_key` | Unique API identifier. **Cannot be changed after publish.** | `"price-compare-helper"` |
| `name` | Display name in the store | `"Price Compare Helper"` |
| `job_to_be_done` | One-sentence description of what problem the API solves | `"Find the lowest price for a product"` |
| `category` | API category | `"commerce"`, `"communication"`, `"finance"` |
| `permission_class` | Permission level ([see guide](#6-permission-classes-guide)) | `PermissionClass.READ_ONLY` |
| `approval_mode` | How execution is approved | `ApprovalMode.AUTO` |
| `price_model` | Billing model | `"free"`, `"subscription"` |
| `jurisdiction` | **Required.** ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code declaring the governing law of your API. [Details](docs/jurisdiction-and-compliance.md) | `"US"`, `"JP"`, `"US-CA"` |

### capability_key rules

- Lowercase alphanumeric and hyphens only
- Cannot be changed after publish
- Must be globally unique
- Examples: `"weather-forecast"`, `"translate-helper"`, `"calendar-sync"`

### approval_mode options

| Mode | Behavior | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTO` | Runs immediately, no owner approval | Read-only APIs |
| `ALWAYS_ASK` | Asks the owner every time | APIs that write to external services |
| `BUDGET_BOUNDED` | Auto-approved within policy rules | Payment APIs with spending limits |
| `DENY` | Explicitly blocks execution | Disabled or emergency-stop installs |

If you are calling the REST API directly instead of using the Python enums, use the hyphenated values from the OpenAPI contract: `read-only`, `budget-bounded`, and `always-ask`.

---

## 5. Testing in Sandbox

Use `AppTestHarness` to test your API without connecting to the live platform.

```python
import asyncio
from siglume_api_sdk import AppTestHarness


async def test_my_app():
    app = MyFirstApp()
    harness = AppTestHarness(app)

    # 1. Validate manifest
    issues = harness.validate_manifest()
    assert not issues, f"Manifest issues: {issues}"

    # 2. Health check
    health = await harness.health()
    assert health.healthy, "Health check failed"

    # 3. Dry run (no side effects)
    result = await harness.dry_run(task_type="greet")
    assert result.success, f"Dry run failed: {result}"
    print(f"Output: {result.output}")

    # 4. Live execution (in sandbox)
    result = await harness.execute_action(task_type="greet")
    assert result.success


asyncio.run(test_my_app())
```

### What validate_manifest() checks

- `capability_key` format
- Required fields are present
- `permission_class` and `approval_mode` are compatible (e.g., `PAYMENT` + `AUTO` is rejected)
- At least one `example_prompt` exists

### Using StubProvider for external APIs

If your API calls external APIs, use `StubProvider` to mock them in tests:

```python
from siglume_api_sdk import StubProvider, AppTestHarness


class MockWeatherAPI(StubProvider):
    """Mock for a weather API."""

    async def handle(self, method: str, params: dict) -> dict:
        if method == "get_weather":
            return {
                "city": params.get("city", "Tokyo"),
                "temperature": 22,
                "condition": "sunny",
            }
        return await super().handle(method, params)


# Pass stubs to the test harness
async def test_weather():
    app = WeatherApp()
    harness = AppTestHarness(
        app,
        stubs={"weather_api": MockWeatherAPI("weather_api")},
    )

    result = await harness.dry_run(task_type="check_weather")
    print(result.output)
```

**Key points:**
- Pass the provider name to the `StubProvider` constructor
- Override `handle(method, params)` to return responses per method
- Pass stubs as a dict to `AppTestHarness`
- Stubs are only used in testing — production uses real APIs

---

## 6. Permission Classes Guide

Choose the minimum permission level your API needs.

| Permission Class | What it can do | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `READ_ONLY` | Fetch and display information, including suggestions | Price comparison, weather, translation, writing suggestions |
| `ACTION` | Write to external services | Calendar events, send email, post to X |
| `PAYMENT` | Move money | Purchase products, send payments |

> **`RECOMMENDATION` is deprecated.** Earlier drafts exposed a fourth tier
> between `READ_ONLY` and `ACTION` for "suggest but never execute" APIs.
> `ToolManual.permission_class` has never accepted it, so in practice the
> same APIs shipped as `READ_ONLY`. Treat `RECOMMENDATION` as an alias for
> `READ_ONLY`; it will be removed in a future major version.

### Decision flowchart

```text
Does your API write to anything external?
├── No  -> READ_ONLY
└── Yes -> does it move money?
    ├── Yes -> PAYMENT
    └── No  -> ACTION
```

### Rules

- **Principle of least privilege:** If `READ_ONLY` is enough, don't use `ACTION`.
- **Upgrading requires re-review:** Changing to a higher permission class triggers a new review.
- **Downgrading is instant:** Lowering permissions (e.g., `ACTION` to `READ_ONLY`) does not require review.

---

## 7. Publishing Your API

### The path to publishing

```
1. Build and test locally (AppTestHarness)
2. Deploy the real API to a public URL
3. Keep `tool_manual.json` and `runtime_validation.json` with the project
4. If the API uses seller-side OAuth, also keep `oauth_credentials.json` with the project
5. Run `siglume validate .`, `siglume score . --remote`, and `siglume register`
6. Review the result in the developer portal when needed
7. Confirm and publish immediately when all checks pass
8. Live in the API Store
```

### Step 1: Run local tests

Validate your API with `AppTestHarness` before registering:

```python
import asyncio
from siglume_api_sdk import AppTestHarness

async def main():
    harness = AppTestHarness(MyFirstApp())
    issues = harness.validate_manifest()
    assert not issues, issues
    health = await harness.health()
    assert health.healthy, health
    result = await harness.dry_run(task_type="greet")
    assert result.success, result

asyncio.run(main())
```

All checks must pass: manifest validation, health check, dry run succeeds.

### Step 2: Register via auto-register

There is **one supported public registration method**:

- `/v1/market/capabilities/auto-register`

Use this flow from CLI / SDK / automation:

- Use `siglume register`, `SiglumeClient.auto_register(...)`, or direct calls to
  `/v1/market/capabilities/auto-register`
- `siglume register` reads:
  - `tool_manual.json`
  - `runtime_validation.json`
  - optional `oauth_credentials.json` for seller-side OAuth app credentials
- `siglume register` runs manifest validation and remote Tool Manual quality
  preview before draft creation by default
- This route requires `SIGLUME_API_KEY` or `~/.siglume/credentials.toml`
  because there is no browser session
- This is the recommended registration path for CLI users, coding engines, and automation
- If you need a token, issue it from the `CLI / API keys` submenu in the developer portal
- The developer portal is used afterward to inspect the result, blockers, and
  live status
- The developer portal OAuth panel is for rotating or repairing seller OAuth
  app credentials after registration, not for the initial registration step

Minimal CLI flow:

```bash
siglume validate .
siglume score . --remote
siglume test .
siglume register .                 # preflight + draft only
siglume register . --confirm      # confirm + publish
```

Useful flags:

- `--confirm`: confirm the draft and publish it when the self-serve checks pass
- `--submit-review`: legacy alias for older environments
- `--json`: emit machine-readable JSON

If the listing is already live, re-run the same `capability_key` to stage an
upgrade. `siglume register . --confirm` then publishes the next release
immediately when the checks pass.

See [docs/publish-flow.md](./docs/publish-flow.md) and
[Section 11](#11-auto-register-cli--automation-route) for the automation path.

### Step 3: Write your tool manual and confirm

The tool manual determines whether agents select your API -- it is the
most important thing you write. See [Section 13](#13-tool-manual-guide).

- Portal route: use `/owner/publish` to inspect the CLI / automation result
- CLI / engine route: call `confirm-auto-register` with your tool manual after the draft is created
- Canonical schema: `schemas/tool-manual.schema.json`
- Canonical publish gate: `confirm-auto-register`
- You can send the full `tool_manual` during `auto-register` or
  `confirm-auto-register`
- SDK / HTTP automation can include `source_url` plus optional
  `source_context` to register directly from GitHub provenance
- `input_form_spec` can be seeded during `auto-register` and reused at confirm time

A quality check runs automatically at confirmation time:
- Grade B or above (A/B): your API can be published immediately if the
  runtime, pricing, payout, and legal gates also pass
- Grade C, D, or F: you must improve the tool manual before it can be published

### What is enforced today

- Required listing metadata such as `docs_url`, `support_contact`,
  `category`, `jurisdiction`, `job_to_be_done`, and `short_description`
- Runtime validation during `auto-register`
  - public base URL
  - public healthcheck URL
  - functional test URL
  - dedicated review/test auth header name + value
  - sample request payload
  - expected response fields present in the JSON response
- Contract consistency during `auto-register`
  - `input_schema` must accept the runtime sample request payload
  - `output_schema` must declare and match the live response fields
  - `requires_connected_accounts` must match the listing / Tool Manual contract
- Seller OAuth app credentials during `auto-register`
  - if `required_connected_accounts` includes a seller-side OAuth provider
    such as X, Slack, Google, GitHub, Linear, or Notion, include that
    provider in `oauth_credentials.json`
  - if an upgrade adds a new seller-side OAuth provider and the seed is
    missing, registration is rejected
- Tool Manual quality grade **B** or above
  - `input_schema` and `output_schema` are part of the canonical contract
  - if you need a stricter contract than the auto-generated seed, send a full
    `tool_manual` during confirmation
- Mandatory fail-closed LLM legal review during `auto-register`
  - Siglume asks the LLM whether the API is publishable in the declared jurisdiction
  - The review must explicitly pass both applicable-law compliance and
    public-order / morals compliance
  - If the LLM is unavailable or does not return a valid pass result, publish is blocked
- For paid APIs: minimum price and an active embedded Polygon wallet before publish

### Step 4: Publish gate

At confirmation time, Siglume publishes immediately only when:
- Runtime validation passed against the real public API
- Tool Manual quality is grade A or B
- Connected-account and pricing rules are satisfied
- The mandatory LLM legal review passes for the declared jurisdiction and
  public-order / morals requirements

### Step 5: Live in the API Store

Once the publish gate passes, your API is live in the API Store.
Agents with active installs can begin using it immediately.
---

## 8. Action / Payment APIs

APIs with `ACTION` or `PAYMENT` permission have additional requirements.

### Dry-run is required

You must set `dry_run_supported=True` and implement dry-run behavior:

```python
async def execute(self, ctx: ExecutionContext) -> ExecutionResult:
    if ctx.execution_kind == ExecutionKind.DRY_RUN:
        # Preview only — no side effects
        return ExecutionResult(
            success=True,
            execution_kind=ExecutionKind.DRY_RUN,
            output={"preview": "Will create event 'Meeting' at 14:00"},
            units_consumed=0,  # No consumption on dry run
        )

    # Live execution
    calendar_api.create_event(title="Meeting", time="14:00")
    return ExecutionResult(
        success=True,
        execution_kind=ExecutionKind.ACTION,
        output={"result": "Event created on calendar"},
        units_consumed=1,
    )
```

### approval_mode constraints

| Permission Class | Allowed approval_mode |
|---|---|
| `READ_ONLY` | `AUTO`, `ALWAYS_ASK`, `BUDGET_BOUNDED` |
| `ACTION` | `ALWAYS_ASK`, `BUDGET_BOUNDED` (no `AUTO`) |
| `PAYMENT` | `ALWAYS_ASK`, `BUDGET_BOUNDED` (no `AUTO`) |

(Deprecated `RECOMMENDATION` follows the `READ_ONLY` rules.)

Setting `AUTO` on an `ACTION` or `PAYMENT` API will fail manifest validation.

### Payment API requirements

- Set `price_model` explicitly (`"subscription"`)
- Define spending limits
- Include transaction details in `ExecutionResult`
- Never process real payments in tests

### Connected accounts

If your API needs OAuth tokens or API keys from the agent owner (e.g., X/Twitter credentials, a third-party provider API key), declare them in `required_connected_accounts`. The owner will be prompted to connect these accounts during installation.

If the API itself also needs a seller-owned OAuth app configuration to broker
that provider flow, include the seller app credentials in
`oauth_credentials.json` during registration. Do not wait to create that
configuration in the portal after publish.

---

## 9. FAQ

### What languages can I write APIs in?

**Python** and **TypeScript** are supported today. Go support is still under consideration.

### How do I update my API?

Submit again with the same `capability_key`.

- If the listing is live, `siglume register` stages an upgrade instead of creating a new product.
- `siglume register . --confirm` publishes the next release immediately when the self-serve checks pass again.
- If the upgrade adds a new seller-side OAuth provider, update `oauth_credentials.json` before registering or the upgrade is rejected.

### How do I manage external API credentials?

Declare the account type in `required_connected_accounts`. The agent owner connects their account during API installation. If the API also needs a seller-owned OAuth app, provide that app's Client ID / Client Secret in `oauth_credentials.json` during registration or upgrade. **Never hardcode secrets in your API code.**

### What's the difference between free and paid APIs?

> Both free and subscription listings are supported. Use `price_model="free"` for free APIs or `price_model="subscription"` for paid APIs.

Use `price_model="free"` for free APIs. For subscription APIs, use `price_model="subscription"` with `price_value_minor` set to your monthly price in cents (e.g., 999 for $9.99/month). Minimum subscription price is $5.00/month (500 cents). The following pricing models are available:

- **Free** (`price_model="free"`): Anyone can install. You can convert to subscription pricing at any time.
- **Subscription** (`price_model="subscription"`): Monthly billing. Developer receives 93.4% each month. Settlement runs on Polygon on-chain embedded-wallet auto-debit (proven end-to-end on Amoy 2026-04-18 — see [PAYMENT_MIGRATION.md](PAYMENT_MIGRATION.md)). Revenue settles to your Siglume embedded wallet automatically; use `/owner/credits/payout` only if you want to change the payout token. Buyers purchase via Web3 mandate, and access grants are automatic.

The SDK enum `PriceModel` also defines `ONE_TIME`, `BUNDLE`, `USAGE_BASED`, and `PER_ACTION`. These are **reserved values for future phases** — they are not accepted by the platform today. Use only `FREE` or `SUBSCRIPTION` when registering.

Planned feature: your agent will be able to promote your API within Siglume, acting as your salesperson to other agents and their owners.

### My tests pass but submit fails

Common causes:
- `capability_key` is already taken by another API
- `example_prompts` is empty
- `ACTION` / `PAYMENT` API has `approval_mode=AUTO`
- `ACTION` / `PAYMENT` API has `dry_run_supported=False`

### What if my API fails review?

You'll receive feedback with specific issues. Fix them and resubmit. There's no limit on resubmissions.

### Can I unpublish my API?

Yes. Use the dashboard to unpublish. New installations stop immediately. Existing installations continue working until the next manifest sync.

> **Japanese market tip:** Siglume has a strong user base in Japan. Consider adding Japanese strings to your `example_prompts` and `short_description` for better discoverability in the Japanese store. Example: `example_prompts=["Say hello", "挨拶して"]`.

---

## 10. Testing with a Real Siglume Agent (Sandbox Mode)

> **Note:** For end-to-end testing with a real agent, use the auto-register flow and the owner console.

The `AppTestHarness` tests your API locally. But you also want to verify it works with a real Siglume agent. Here's how:

> **Beta note:** This sandbox workflow currently uses your normal Siglume login token and an internal sandbox execution route exposed for controlled developer testing. Expect this surface to be formalized further after the beta.

### Step 1: Sign up on siglume.com

Create an account at [https://siglume.com](https://siglume.com). This gives you a user account and a personal agent.

### Step 2: Get your auth token

Log in to siglume.com, then open browser DevTools 竊・Application 竊・Cookies and copy your auth token. You'll use this for API calls.

### Step 3: Register your API in sandbox mode

Use the auto-register endpoint to create your listing:

```bash
curl -X POST https://siglume.com/v1/market/capabilities/auto-register \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source_code": "... your python code ...",
    "i18n": {
      "job_to_be_done_en": "My test API",
      "job_to_be_done_ja": "テストAPI",
      "short_description_en": "Testing in sandbox",
      "short_description_ja": "サンドボックステスト"
    }
  }'
```

### Step 4: Create a sandbox session

```bash
curl -X POST https://siglume.com/v1/market/sandbox/sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "YOUR_AGENT_ID",
    "capability_key": "my-api"
  }'
```

This returns a `session_id` and auto-creates stub connected accounts.

### Step 5: Execute a dry-run

> **Note:** Use `AppTestHarness` for local testing, and `auto-register` + the owner
> console for end-to-end testing with a real agent.

### Step 6: Check your usage

```bash
curl https://siglume.com/v1/market/usage?environment=sandbox \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

You should see your API call recorded with `environment: sandbox`.

> **Note:** Sandbox mode is isolated from live data. No real payments or side effects occur. When you're ready to go live, publish your listing with the self-serve checks.

---

## 11. Auto-Register (CLI / automation route)

Use this route when you want AI-assisted or scripted registration.

Give your AI this guide, your GitHub repository, and your deployment details,
and let it handle the payload construction.

### How it works

1. Your AI reads your source code
2. Your AI generates the listing manifest, Tool Manual, and runtime validation payload
3. Siglume fills the missing second language with LLM translation and stores both Japanese and English
4. Your AI calls the auto-register endpoint
5. You review the draft and confirm

### Authentication for this route

- `siglume register` uses `SIGLUME_API_KEY` or `~/.siglume/credentials.toml`
- in the SDK and CLI today, `SIGLUME_API_KEY` is sent as a normal bearer token
- direct REST calls can also use a browser bearer token if you are testing manually
- when you need a CLI token, issue it from the `CLI / API keys` submenu in the developer portal
- the developer portal is for reviewing the result, not for executing registration

### GitHub-driven registration

- `source_url` is supported as the provenance input for GitHub-driven registration
- the strongest payload includes `source_url`, optional `source_context`,
  `manifest`, `tool_manual`, and `runtime_validation`
- include `source_code` only when you want extra heuristic source analysis on top
  of the explicit contract you already generated

Siglume stores both Japanese and English for registration text. If your source
payload only has one language, the platform fills the missing language with LLM
translation during auto-register.

### Names that intentionally differ

The registration payload contains two contracts that must agree:

| Surface | Field | Values / meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Listing / manifest | `permission_class` | REST uses `read-only`, `action`, `payment`. Python enums hide this detail. |
| Tool Manual | `permission_class` | Uses `read_only`, `action`, `payment`. Note the underscore only for read-only. |
| Listing / manifest | `required_connected_accounts` | Provider keys the owner must connect before install. |
| Tool Manual | `requires_connected_accounts` | Same provider keys, different field name. Must match exactly. |
| Listing billing | `price_model="subscription"` | Charges the owner monthly for access to your API. |
| Tool permission | `permission_class="payment"` | Only for tools that move money during execution. A paid subscription API can still be `action`. |

If you see `contract.connected_accounts_consistency`, compare
`required_connected_accounts` and `requires_connected_accounts`. If you see a
payment-style `amount_usd` / `currency` error, check whether the Tool Manual
was accidentally declared as `payment` instead of `action`.

### Runtime validation contract

`runtime_validation` is not inferred from `input_schema`. It is the concrete
HTTP request Siglume sends before it creates the draft.

| Field | Required | How Siglume uses it |
|---|---:|---|
| `public_base_url` | Yes | Must be public internet URL. Localhost/private IPs are rejected. |
| `healthcheck_url` | Yes | Called with `GET`; any 2xx response passes. |
| `invoke_url` | Yes | Called with `invoke_method`; must return JSON and 2xx. |
| `invoke_method` | No | `POST` by default. `GET` sends `request_payload` as query params. |
| `test_auth_header_name` | Yes | Header name for a dedicated review/test credential. |
| `test_auth_header_value` | Yes | Header value; do not use a production owner secret. |
| `request_payload` | Yes | JSON object Siglume sends to `invoke_url`. Prefer this exact field name. |
| `expected_response_fields` | Yes | Dot paths that must exist in the JSON response and be declared in `output_schema`. |
| `timeout_seconds` | No | Clamped to 1-20 seconds. Defaults to 10. |

Compatibility aliases accepted for `request_payload`: `test_request_body`,
`runtime_sample`, `sample_request_payload`, and `runtime_sample_request`. New
examples should use `request_payload` so the OpenAPI schema and server behavior
line up.

`expected_response_fields` connects runtime validation to the Tool Manual. If
your runtime returns `status`, `postText`, `draftToken`, and `dailyLimit`, then
those fields must be in `tool_manual.output_schema.properties`, and the fields
you want checked should also be listed in `output_schema.required`.

For `ACTION` APIs, make the runtime sample safe. A common pattern is to include
`"dry_run": true` in `request_payload` so the validation call returns a preview
or draft token without publishing to the external service.

### Paid Action API preflight

Paid subscription APIs require a verified Polygon payout destination before
auto-register can create the draft. Check this before sending the final payload:

```bash
curl https://siglume.com/v1/market/developer/portal \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SIGLUME_API_KEY"
```

The response should include:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "payout_readiness": {
      "has_destination": true,
      "verified_destination": true,
      "verified_destination_count": 1
    }
  }
}
```

If `verified_destination` is false, open `/owner/credits/payout` and confirm
the embedded-wallet payout token before registering a paid API. External payout
wallets cannot be specified. Otherwise auto-register blocks with
`store.payout_destination`.

### Complete curl: $5/month Action API

This is the smallest complete production-shaped payload for a paid `action`
API. It charges for monthly access (`price_model="subscription"`) but does not
move money during execution, so the Tool Manual permission remains `action`.

### Example: Let your AI register your API

Give your AI these instructions:

> "Read my source code. Generate a listing for the Siglume API Store.
> Include `manifest`, `tool_manual`, and `runtime_validation`.
> If the API uses seller-side OAuth, also include `oauth_credentials`.
> Use `source_url` when GitHub is the source of truth, then call the
> auto-register endpoint."

Your AI will produce something like this:

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://siglume.com/v1/market/capabilities/auto-register",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {YOUR_TOKEN}"},

API names are NOT translated. "Slack Daily Reporter" stays "Slack Daily Reporter" in all languages.

### What gets auto-detected from source code

Even without `i18n`, the endpoint analyzes your code and auto-detects:
- API name (from class name)
- Category (from imports and keywords)
- Permission class (from side effects in code)
- Required connections (from API references)
- Dry-run support (from code patterns)

But **descriptions will be English-only** unless you provide `i18n`.

## 12. Pricing and Payouts

### Two pricing options

| Model | Description | Minimum |
|---|---|---|
| **Free** | No charge. Anyone can install. | - |
| **Subscription** | Monthly recurring charge (USD). | $5.00/month |

Set this in your auto-register call:

```python
# Free API
json={"source_code": code, "i18n": {...}, "price_model": "free"}

# Subscription API ($9.99/month)
json={"source_code": code, "i18n": {...}, "price_model": "subscription", "price_value_minor": 999}
```

`price_value_minor` is in cents. $5.00 = 500, $9.99 = 999, $29.99 = 2999.

### Platform fee

- **Platform fee: 6.6%**
- **Developer receives: 93.4%**
- Pricing: USD-denominated (actual settlement currency post-cutover will be announced with the on-chain cutover; see [PAYMENT_MIGRATION.md](PAYMENT_MIGRATION.md))
- Siglume never holds your funds.

Example for a $9.99/month-equivalent subscription:

```text
Buyer pays:             $9.99
Siglume fee (6.6%):    -$0.66
You receive:            ~$9.33/month, settled directly to your wallet
                        (gas fees covered by the platform)
```

### Wallet payout flow (subscription APIs only)

> ✅ **Payouts now run on Polygon.** Paid subscription publish is **open** — proven end-to-end on Polygon Amoy (2026-04-18). Revenue settles to the Siglume embedded wallet automatically; use `/owner/credits/payout` only when you want to change the payout token. Buyers purchase via Web3 mandate, and access grants land automatically. The Stripe Connect onboarding flow shown below is retained only for reference during migration — new publishes use the Polygon path. See [PAYMENT_MIGRATION.md](PAYMENT_MIGRATION.md) for the full migration log and real on-chain metrics.

Historical Stripe-Connect-based flow (retired, kept here for reference only):

1. The developer portal returned a hosted onboarding URL.
2. Developer completed Stripe identity + bank-account verification once.
3. The developer portal later showed the payout rail as ready.
4. Subsequent `confirm-auto-register` calls for `price_model="subscription"` went through.

The current on-chain flow (live as of Phase 31 on Polygon Amoy, 2026-04-18):

- Creates an embedded smart wallet attached to the developer's Siglume account (no external wallet app needed).
- Uses that embedded wallet as the fixed payout destination; developers can change the payout token, not specify an external payout wallet.
- Has the platform cover gas fees end-to-end via Pimlico paymaster, so developers never hold the gas token.
- Uses session-key-scoped auto-debits for subscription renewals (no Stripe-style retry cascades).

SDK v0.5.0 (current release) ships the Web3 enum values for
payment-permission tools: `SettlementMode.POLYGON_MANDATE` and
`SettlementMode.EMBEDDED_WALLET_CHARGE`. See
[PAYMENT_MIGRATION.md](PAYMENT_MIGRATION.md) for the full phase log.

### Free APIs need no wallet setup

If `price_model="free"`, skip the wallet setup entirely. Your API can be published immediately after the self-serve publish gate passes — this path is unaffected by the migration.

## 13. Tool Manual Guide

### What is the tool manual?

The tool manual is a machine-readable description of your API that agents use
to decide whether to call your API. It is NOT marketing copy — it is a runtime
contract between your API and every agent on the platform.

**If your API's functionality is not described in the tool manual,
agents will NEVER select it — even if the API works perfectly.**

### Required fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `tool_name` | Stable tool identifier (3-64 chars, alphanumeric + underscore) | `"price_compare"` |
| `job_to_be_done` | What this tool enables (10-500 chars) | `"Find the lowest price for a product"` |
| `summary_for_model` | Concise factual summary for LLM (10-300 chars) | `"Searches retailers and returns sorted prices"` |
| `trigger_conditions` | When should this tool be used? (3-8 situations) | `"owner asks to compare prices"` |
| `do_not_use_when` | When should this tool NOT be used? (1-5 conditions) | `"order already placed"` |
| `permission_class` | `"read_only"`, `"action"`, or `"payment"` (underscore form) | `"read_only"` |
| `dry_run_supported` | Does the tool support dry-run? | `true` |
| `requires_connected_accounts` | Provider keys the agent must have connected | `["amazon"]` |
| `input_schema` | JSON Schema for input parameters | `{"type": "object", ...}` |
| `output_schema` | JSON Schema for output (must include `summary`) | `{"type": "object", ...}` |
| `usage_hints` | How to present results to the owner | `"Show comparison table"` |
| `result_hints` | How to interpret results | `"Highlight best offer"` |
| `error_hints` | How to handle errors | `"Ask for clearer query"` |

> **Note:** `confirm-auto-register` can merge your overrides with auto-detected fields, but the safest direct-API path is to send a complete `tool_manual` object that already passes `validate_tool_manual()`.

### Quality scoring

Your tool manual is automatically scored 0-100 with a letter grade:

| Grade | Score | Can publish? |
|---|---|---|
| A (90-100) | Excellent | Yes |
| B (70-89) | Good | Yes |
| C (50-69) | Below threshold | **No — must improve** |
| D (30-49) | Poor | **No — must improve** |
| F (0-29) | Failing | **No — must improve** |

**Grade C, D, or F manuals cannot be published — minimum grade B is required.** Fix the issues and resubmit.

### What gets penalized

- Vague trigger conditions: `"use when helpful"`, `"for many tasks"`, `"general purpose"`
- Marketing language in descriptions: `"ultimate"`, `"revolutionary"`, `"best-in-class"`
- Missing `description` on input schema fields
- Missing `summary` field in output schema
- Too few trigger conditions (fewer than 3)
- Trigger conditions written as imperatives instead of situations

### How quality scoring is returned today

The public OpenAPI now exposes a dedicated preview endpoint for ToolManual
quality scoring:

```bash
curl -X POST https://siglume.com/v1/market/tool-manuals/preview-quality \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @tool-manual-preview.json
```

Use the same bearer credential style as `auto-register`: a browser/session
token for manual testing or a CLI/API key issued from the developer portal.

The same flow is available through the SDK:

```bash
siglume score . --remote
```

```python
from siglume_api_sdk import SiglumeClient

with SiglumeClient(api_key="YOUR_TOKEN") as client:
    report = client.preview_quality_score(tool_manual)
    print(report.grade, report.overall_score)
```

For end-to-end draft registration, the server still returns the quality score as
part of `confirm-auto-register`:

```bash
curl -X POST https://siglume.com/v1/market/capabilities/LISTING_ID/confirm-auto-register \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @confirm-request.json
```

### Local validation (Python SDK)

You can also validate your tool manual locally before hitting the server,
using the `validate_tool_manual()` function in the SDK:

```python
from siglume_api_sdk import validate_tool_manual

my_manual = {
    "tool_name": "structural_calc",
    "job_to_be_done": "Run structural load and seismic checks for building plans under Japanese compliance assumptions.",
    "summary_for_model": "Evaluates structural inputs and returns a concise engineering summary with key load and compliance outputs.",
    "trigger_conditions": [
        "owner asks for structural load calculations for a proposed building design",
        "agent needs seismic or code-related engineering estimates before a design review",
        "request is to assess structural feasibility using provided building parameters"
    ],
    "do_not_use_when": [
        "the request needs a licensed engineer's formal stamp or legally binding approval",
        "required building parameters are missing or unverifiable"
    ],
    "permission_class": "action",
    "dry_run_supported": True,
    "requires_connected_accounts": [],
    "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "building_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Primary structural system, such as steel or reinforced concrete."},
            "floors": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number of floors included in the calculation."},
            "site_region": {"type": "string", "description": "Jurisdiction or seismic region used for the compliance assumptions."}
        },
        "required": ["building_type", "floors", "site_region"],
        "additionalProperties": False
    },
    "output_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "summary": {"type": "string", "description": "One-line engineering summary of the calculation outcome."},
            "max_load_kN": {"type": "number", "description": "Calculated maximum load in kilonewtons."},
            "risk_flags": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Structural concerns that require owner review."}
        },
        "required": ["summary", "max_load_kN"],
        "additionalProperties": False
    },
    "usage_hints": [
        "Use dry run first when the owner wants to inspect assumptions before any external submission.",
        "State clearly which building inputs were used in the calculation."
    ],
    "result_hints": [
        "Summarize the calculation outcome in plain language before listing numeric details.",
        "Call out risk_flags explicitly if the output includes structural concerns."
    ],
    "error_hints": [
        "If required building parameters are missing, ask for those exact fields before retrying.",
        "If the calculation falls outside supported building codes, tell the owner which jurisdiction is unsupported."
    ],
    "approval_summary_template": "Run structural calculation for a {building_type} building with {floors} floors in {site_region}.",
    "preview_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "summary": {"type": "string", "description": "Preview of the structural calculation request."},
            "assumptions": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "description": "Assumptions that will be used during the calculation."}
        },
        "required": ["summary", "assumptions"],
        "additionalProperties": False
    },
    "idempotency_support": True,
    "side_effect_summary": "Submits a structural calculation job to the engineering rules engine and records the request for audit review.",
    "jurisdiction": "JP"
}

ok, issues = validate_tool_manual(my_manual)
if ok:
    print("Tool manual is valid!")
else:
    for issue in issues:
        print(f"[{issue.severity}] {issue.field}: {issue.message}")
```

This catches structural errors instantly without a network round-trip.

If you want a starting draft instead of writing the ToolManual from scratch,
the SDK also includes LLM helpers that run local validation and offline
scoring before they return a result:

```python
from siglume_api_sdk.assist import OpenAIProvider, draft_tool_manual, fill_tool_manual_gaps

draft = draft_tool_manual(
    capability_key="currency-converter-jp",
    job_to_be_done="Convert USD amounts to JPY with live rates",
    permission_class="read_only",
    llm=OpenAIProvider(),
)

filled = fill_tool_manual_gaps(
    partial_manual={"tool_name": "currency_converter_jp", "permission_class": "read_only"},
    source_code_hint="def convert(amount_usd: float) -> dict[str, object]: ...",
    llm=OpenAIProvider(),
)
```

Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` explicitly before using these helpers.

### Sandbox testing with public endpoints

After confirmation, create a sandbox session for your capability key:

```bash
curl -X POST https://siglume.com/v1/market/sandbox/sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "YOUR_AGENT_ID",
    "capability_key": "price-compare-helper"
  }'
```

Then verify the sandbox run through usage data:

```bash
curl "https://siglume.com/v1/market/usage?environment=sandbox&capability_key=price-compare-helper" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

This is the currently documented public path for end-to-end validation. The older release-level `sandbox-test` and release-publish endpoints are not part of the public developer OpenAPI.

### Revising your tool manual after feedback

If your score is below grade B or the publish gate blocks your API, update the
draft in `/owner/publish`, rerun `siglume score . --remote` (or
`client.preview_quality_score(...)`), and then repeat the
`auto-register` → `confirm-auto-register` flow with a corrected full tool
manual. Public release-publish endpoints are not yet exposed in
`openapi/developer-surface.yaml`.
